# LRP Imdb Keras Word2Vec

Implementation of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for sentiment analysis for English Language. The package used to implement LRP is innvestigate. The dataset used is Large Movie Review Dataset (Imdb reviews). The distribution of positive and negative reviews in training and test dataset is also equal (12.5K pos and 12.5 neg reviews in each training and test dataset). The model in use is feed forwards neural network with three dense hidden layers using Keras. The vectorization technique used for text is GloVe word embedding.
